# Shiny
This Shiny-app wants to show some intresting features on the aerospace launches over the last 60 years. The dataset is "Launch.csv", in which are present informations on the year, month, day, hour, minute and second of the launch. There are also the company of origin of the rocket, if the mission was public or private funded, if the mission was succesfull or not and the cost of the mission.
One of the main problem in this analysis is the fact that before the 1995/2000 the costs of missions aren't available, for this reason the analysis throught the app is an approximation of the real expenditures that the states faced over time. Furthermore the costs present in the file aren't the effective cost, but a prevision of the expenditures have to face to complete the mission.

## Plots
The plots included in the Shiny-app are histograms, scatter plot and time series. Some of them allow to choose the data to show

### Histogram of Launches
The plot represent in an inverted histogram how many launches each state had completed. On the x-axis is possible to see the number
